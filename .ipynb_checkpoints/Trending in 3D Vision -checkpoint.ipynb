    "## Trending in 3D Vision\n",
    "Deep learning not only provides good optimization techniques on feaure engineering, but also gives us unimaginable possibility to combine our intutions into research that could explore this 3D world better. In the research field of 3D Vision, a lot of excellent research work is happening. It's not enough to simply divide them into stereo vision, multi-view, monucular based 3D, we actually want to sort out research topics that could both connect with and distinguish from 2D vision. People have done paper collections on 3D as [link1](https://github.com/flamato/3D-computer-vision-resources) [link2](https://github.com/imkaywu/awesome-3d-vision-list), but they don't usually give us a good bird view, or most-updated infos. Based on above reasons, we create this special collection by summerizing the general ideas behind some most recent papers in 3D vision."
