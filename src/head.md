## Trending in 3D Vision
I first got fascinated by the beauty of 3D vision since 2015. After that, so many new and wonderful ideas, works have been brought into this field, and it seems so hard to catch up with this fast-evolving area today. This leads to the major motivation behind this paper reading list: to get a sense of current SOTA methods, and an overview of the research trending in the field of 3D vision, mainly with deep learning.

From this list, you may say, various applications, multiple modalities of data, powerful neural backbones are the major working horses, or the boom of neural radiance field and differentiable rendering inspire a lot of new methods and tasks, or you want to point out that self-supervision, data-efficient learning are the critical keys. Different people may have different opinions, but this list is about existing possibilities in 3D vision, to which you may say 'wow, this is even possible', or 'aha, I never imagined such a method'.

Note that this repo started as a self-collected paper list based on my own appetite, which may reflect some bias. Some may not be precisely categorized, for which you can raise an issue, or send a pull request.
